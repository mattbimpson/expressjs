# expressjs api example

## an expressjs api with typescript, jest and swagger documentation.

### to run, use npm run dev

### to test, use npm run test

### to view api documentation, visit http://localhost:3000/swagger

This api provides examples of routing within express. There is also an example of how to use middleware, in this case to extract a request parameter.

The api also uses swagger to provide documentation via swagger-ui-express & json configuration.

I have added the npm package 'supertest' as a brief example of integration testing.
